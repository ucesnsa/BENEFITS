# BENEFITS

## About

This code is part of the **BENEFITS** project - a European Horizon initiative transforming how social services are evaluated.

🔗 **Project Website:** [benefitsproject.eu](https://benefitsproject.eu/)

## Overview

BENEFITS develops measurement systems that assess social services by their real impact on prosperity, wellbeing, and inclusion - moving beyond traditional cost-based metrics.

## Project Goals

- 📊 **New valuation methods** - Measure social service impact beyond cost
- 🛠️ **Evidence platforms** - Tools for data-driven policy decisions
- 🌍 **Community pilots** - Test improvements in real-world settings
- 📚 **Capacity building** - Training for effective implementation

## The Challenge

Traditional economic measures like GDP capture growth but miss:
- Quality of life improvements
- Community wellbeing
- Environmental impact
- True value of social services

BENEFITS provides policymakers with evidence and frameworks to design fairer, more effective policies.
