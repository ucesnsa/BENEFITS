A European Horizon project transforming how social services are understood and evaluated.
🔗 benefitsproject.eu

Overview
Building measurement systems that assess social services by their real impact — not just cost.
The Problem
GDP measures economic growth, but doesn't capture:

Quality of life
Community wellbeing
Environmental impact
True value of social services

Policymakers lack evidence and tools to demonstrate what works.
The Solution
New frameworks and platforms that measure social services based on prosperity, well-being, and inclusion.

Key Activities
📊 New valuation methods — Move beyond cost to measure real-world impact
🛠️ Evidence platforms — Tools for data-driven policy decisions
🌍 Community pilots — Test improvements in real settings
📚 Capacity building — Training for effective implementation
