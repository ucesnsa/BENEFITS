What We Do
We're building better ways to measure social services — not just by their cost, but by their real impact on people's lives, communities, and the environment.

Why This Matters
Traditional economic measures like GDP tell us how economies grow, but they don't tell us:

How people actually live
Whether social services are improving wellbeing
What truly makes communities thrive

The problem: We know social services make a difference, but policymakers often lack the evidence and tools to prove it.
The solution: BENEFITS fills that gap by providing decision-makers with the evidence and frameworks they need to design fairer, more effective policies.

Our Goals
✨ Value beyond cost — Develop new methods for measuring social services based on their impact on prosperity, wellbeing, and inclusion
🛠️ Practical tools — Create platforms that help local councils and governments make evidence-based decisions
🌍 Real-world testing — Run pilot programs in communities to test and refine improvements
📚 Building capacity — Train service providers and policymakers to use these tools effectively
